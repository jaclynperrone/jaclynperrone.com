        <p>I joined thoughtbot in New York City in October 2015 as a Product Designer, and am now a Design Director.</p>

        <p>Prior to thoughtbot, I started my career as a self-taught Front-end Developer for a small interactive media agency in Manhattan. After a few years of building websites and web apps, I moved on to a User Experience Designer role at Ogilvy & Mather, where I combined my love of code with my love of design. From there, my desire to apply my skills to business strategy and consulting led me to a Product Designer role at Pivotal Labs, where my interest in agile methodologies and user-centric design and development ultimately led me to thoughtbot.</p>

        <p>As Design Director at thoughtbot, I provide mentorship and support to the Boston design team, while assisting with sales, strategy, and client engagements. I have facilitated countless user interviews, design sprints, and workshops, and I very much enjoy giving talks about all those things.</p>
