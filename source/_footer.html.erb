        <p>I joined Quora in 2021 as a Product Design Manager and Design Lead for their Monetization team. I provide mentorship and support to the designers, while collaborating with cross-functional teams and leadership on strategic goals and high-impact opportunities.</p>

        <p>Prior to Quora, I started my career as a self-taught Front-end Developer for an interactive media agency in Manhattan. After a few years of building websites and web apps, I moved on to a Product Designer role at Pivotal Labs, where I combined my love of code with my love for design. From there, I applied my skills to business strategy and consulting as Design Director at thoughtbot, where my interest in agile methodologies and user-centric design and development ultimately led me to Quora.</p>

        <p>Over the course of my career I have facilitated countless user interviews, design sprints, and workshops, and I very much enjoy giving talks about all those things. I am also a nights-and-weekends artist, and enjoy painting, drawing, and playing my guitar at every chance I get!</p>
