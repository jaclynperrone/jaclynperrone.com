        <p>I joined Groups Recover Together in 2022 as a Senior Product Designer on their product team. I collaborate with developers, managers, and stakeholders to shape the digital experience for our members and staff, in support of our mission to help people reclaim their lives from addiction.</p>

        <p>Prior to Groups, I started my career as a self-taught Front-end Developer for an interactive media agency in Manhattan. After a few years of building websites and web apps, I moved on to a Product Designer role at Pivotal Labs, where I combined my love of code with my love for design. From there, I applied my skills to business strategy and consulting as Design Director at thoughtbot, where my interest in agile methodologies and user-centric design and development ultimately led me to Groups.</p>

        <p>Over the course of my career I have facilitated countless user interviews, design sprints, and workshops, and I very much enjoy giving talks about all those things. I am also a nights-and-weekends artist, and enjoy painting, drawing, and playing my guitar every chance I get!</p>
